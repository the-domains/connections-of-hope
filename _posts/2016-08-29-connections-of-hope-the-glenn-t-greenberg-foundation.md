My Story

March 23, 2013 started out like any other day. I left my
house to do errands like I'd done so many Saturdays before that and while I was
away, my husband Glenn suffered a massive brain hemorrhage.

We never spoke to each other again. 

I never met anyone like Glenn before. He loved me from the
start and never got tired of the chase. He would draw hearts on our bathroom
mirror with my nail polish and leave beautifully wrapped presents for to find
when I got home from work. He was intelligent and sincere. Handsome and humble.
He was a true romantic. 

Glenn T. Greenberg was the love of my life. 

Just a few nights before, Glenn and I were having one of our
many late night conversations. We thought we had decades to go and looked
forward to growing old together and joked about how that will be for us.

Less than a week later I was a widow.

After Glenn died I had no idea what I was in for. The first
few months after a loss the body gives you the gift of shock so you can get
through. 

The movies are wrong. You aren't bed ridden with grief at
the start. You don't wail and cry at the funeral throwing yourself on the
casket. 

I sailed through his funeral even writing and reading his
eulogy and speaking at his memorial service. I even read the 13 pslams at his
burial!

By July of that year with funeral and memorial services
behind me. Cards and condolences had stopped coming.I thought I was free of grief and that I
could simply glide into my new life as a widow.It wasn't so bad, I thought. 

Then boom, shock was gone and grief came over me life a
tsunami. 

I felt alone. I felt misunderstood. I felt hopeless. I felt
lost. I felt unloved. I felt invisible. 

Picture your perfect life. You work hard to get it and it's
yours. Then once day you just have to walk out that front door. You can't look
back. You can't say goodbye. For no reason. No reason at all. That's what its
like to lose a spouse. 

I didn't want to be a widow any more. I wanted Glenn to come
home. The silence was deafening. 

I read every grief book I could get my hands on (hundreds).
They all left me feeling flat. Most are written as self-help books. I wasn't
depressed so making lists of positive affirmations wasn't ever going to bring
Glenn back. The ones that helped were memoirs by widowed authors who just wrote
about their daily life after loss. 

I also started noticing that I could no longer speak of
Glenn. I'd get long bouts of silence with staring glares as if I said a bad
word when I talked about my love. Well-meaning friends would gently suggest
that it was time for me to "move on."

Glenn was an amazing man. He lived a purposeful life. He
touched many. I still loved him. I didn't want to stop speaking of him as if he
never existed. 

I found myself in this sad and lonely place where I secretly
kept Glenn's love and memory alive while pretending to be "moving on," yet
suffering in silence. It was torture. 

I soon knew that in order to find my way through this thing
called grief, I would need to find others like me. I needed to know how others
felt. What others did. 

I went to support groups and started meeting others online.
I learned that I wasn't alone. I found this whole underworld of people that
felt just like I did. Everyone I met said the same thing, they still loved
their spouse and everyone else just wanted them to "move on," when they just
wanted their spouse back. They too felt the deep despair that I did. 

Every year millions of Americans --- women and men, straight
and gay, old and young --- are thrust into the role of widow and widower, forced
to learn how to cope on their own after sharing life with their love. 

Losing a spouse
is one of the worst kinds of loss imaginable. It's like being cut off at the
knees and being forced to walk alone. 

I also started doing research on grief and learned that
"moving on" simply, put DOESN"T WORK. But instead what does, is having an
ongoing relationship with your loved one. Just giving yourself permission to
think of them, to talk to them, to honor them, can help ease the depilating
pain of this thing called grief. There are other tools too that I will share them
all with you on this site. _The Glenn T. Greenberg Foundation of Hope. _

Today I will go and lay a single rose on the Donate Life
float for the Rose Parade in Pasadena, CA. Glenn was a donor and helped 127
people with his donations.I will honor
my love, along with hundreds of other donor families. I will raise a toast to
Glenn afterwards. I may cry. I may feel sad but I also know that by doing
something to honor my sweetheart, I will feel joy in my heart and know that I
was lucky enough to love and be loved deeply. It's comforting. 

Grief is the price we pay for love. Love is beautiful. Love
never dies. There is hope. You will find it here.
